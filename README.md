# Portfolio

This is the source code for my portfolio website, which is built with Vite, React, and Chakra UI.

## Usage

My portfolio is available online [here](https://nickwentworth.me)! It can also be hosted locally:

### Hosting Locally

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), clone this repository, and change directory to the root of this project.

2. Install npm dependencies and run the dev server with:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. An output message should be shown with a local address (http://localhost:5173 by default). Visit in any browser to check out the website!
