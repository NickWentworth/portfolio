summary: 'This series of posts go through a high-level overview of how I programmed my chess engine, Otter.'

My engine was written fully from scratch in Rust and implements many popular chess engine techniques and algorithms, detailed throughout these posts. The posts generally focus less on the exact code implemented and are more based in the theory of chess engines with some supplementary code snippets included.

If you'd instead like to see exactly how things are written, check out Otter's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/NickWentworth/otter)!
